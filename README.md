# Web Engineering Coding Playground Template

This repository is designed as the foundation for coding playgrounds in the Web Engineering course. It offers a structured space for experimenting with and mastering various web development technologies and practices. 
The project is based on [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Accessibility_troubleshooting) repository from MDN.

The project introduces a lot of code smells for you to tackle. 
**Let's get coding!**

## Submission Details and Deadlines
* Coding playgrounds are **individual** work
* Use this base template to create your project repository.
* Submit your repository link once.
* Each playground must be submitted via a new branch in that repository (last commit within deadline will be graded).
  * Naming conventions of branch: <code>playground-1</code>, <code>playground-2</code>, ...

# Coding Playground Description

## 1. JS Playground
The provided base project template contains bad coding and templating practices and bugs for you to fix. Take a look into the component files and get a grasp of the inner workings of the provided project. The app should provide the requirements described below. Some are implemented poorly or do not work at all. 

### App Requirements
* On page load the app requests the Wikipedia API to extract bear information from Wikipedia's [list of ursids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ursids). The page then renders the provided image, the common name, the scientific name and it's range.
  * the bears should be ordered in the same order and number (no duplicates) as in the corresponding Wiki page.
  * if there is no image available, the app should show a placeholder image.
* Users are able to toggle the comment section.
* Users are able to leave their name and a comment (both should not be empty).
* Users are able to search the web page contents using a search query, whereby only the html contents with tag <code>article</code> should be highlighted.

### Tasks
Fix the application code and support them with short code examples where useful.

#### Task 1: Introduce ES modules

Split the code into separate script files and use ES modules (`import`/`export`). Choose module boundaries that separate concerns and avoid circular dependencies.

**Theory question:** How does an ES module differ from a classic script with respect to scope, strict mode, loading, and bindings? Explain why the module boundaries you chose make the application easier to maintain.

#### Task 2: Correct the application behavior

Fix the semantic and functional issues according to the app requirements. Use appropriate DOM queries and event handling, and ensure the bear list has the same order and number of entries as the source page.

**Theory question:** Describe event propagation (capturing, target, and bubbling). Where could event delegation be useful in this application, and what trade-off would it introduce?

#### Task 3: Make failures explicit

Add error handling with `try`/`catch` and show useful, user-facing error messages. Check whether each image can be loaded and render a placeholder when it cannot. Do not represent a failed request as valid empty data.

**Theory question:** How do synchronous exceptions and rejected promises travel through this application? Explain where errors should be caught and why catching every error at its source can make failures harder to diagnose.

#### Task 4: Refactor asynchronous control flow

Replace promise callback chains with `async`/`await` and refactor suitable callbacks to arrow functions. Run independent asynchronous operations concurrently where doing so is safe.

**Theory question:** Explain the relationship between `async`/`await`, promises, the microtask queue, and the browser event loop. Also explain why an arrow function is not always an interchangeable replacement for a regular function, particularly regarding `this`.

#### Task 5: Remove remaining code smells

Find and eliminate the remaining bad coding practices. Consider scope, accidental globals, mutation and shared references, function responsibilities, naming, duplication, and DOM update patterns. Document each relevant finding, why it is problematic, and how you fixed it below.

**Theory question:** Select one of your refactorings and explain how JavaScript scope, closures, references, or prototypes caused the original risk. State how you verified that your refactoring preserved behavior.

## 2. Dependency- and Build Management Playground
Build the application with ``npm`` and a build and a dependency management tool of your choice (e.g. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), or others). 

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Establish the build

Set up the project with `npm` and a build tool of your choice (for example, Vite or Webpack). Keep source files separate from generated distribution files and commit the package-manager lockfile.

**Theory question:** Distinguish source, build, distribution, and deployment. What does your build tool do in development and in a production build, and why is the lockfile important for reproducibility?

#### Task 2: Migrate to TypeScript

Use TypeScript as the primary development language and adapt the source files and configuration accordingly. Enable strict checking, model the application's domain data, and validate data received from external APIs before treating it as a typed value.

**Theory question:** TypeScript uses structural typing and erases types during compilation. Explain both concepts and why a compile-time type alone cannot guarantee the shape of a Wikipedia API response at runtime.

#### Task 3: Add static analysis and formatting

Configure ESLint and Prettier using the rulesets below. Resolve all reported errors in the application code and avoid disabling rules without a written justification.

**Theory question:** What different problems do a linter, a formatter, and the TypeScript compiler detect? Give one concrete example for each from this project.

#### Task 4: Provide a consistent command interface

Define the following tasks within `npm scripts`:

  * `dev`: starts the development server.
  * `build`: runs the typescript compiler and bundles your application - bundling depends on your chosen build tool (e.g. Vite, Webpack) but typically bundles multiple files into one, applies optimizations like minification and obfuscation and outputs final results to a `dist` or `build` directory.
  * `lint`: runs ESLint on all  `.js` and `.ts` files in your projects `/src` directory.
  * `lint:fix`: runs and also fixes all issues found by ESLint.
  * `format`: formats all `.js` and `.ts` files in your projects `/src` directory.
  * `format:check`: checks if the files in the `/src` directory are formatted according to Prettier's rules.

The `build`, `lint`, and `format:check` commands must exit with a non-zero status when their checks fail.

**Theory question:** Why are stable, composable commands such as these useful as an interface for developers and CI? Explain idempotence and identify which of your scripts should be idempotent.

#### Task 5: Enforce quality before integration

Configure a pre-commit hook that checks staged code using [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged). Configure a continuous-integration workflow that installs dependencies from the lockfile and runs the non-mutating build, type, lint, and formatting checks for every push or pull request.

**Theory question:** Compare a local pre-commit hook with a CI quality gate. Why is CI still necessary when hooks are configured, and why should CI use non-mutating checks rather than automatically rewriting source files?


**ESLint Configurations**

Use ESLint configs [standard-with-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript) and [TypeScript ESLint Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin).
Your `.eslintrc` file should have the following extensions:
```.eslintrc.yml
...
extends:
  - standard-with-typescript
  - plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended
  - plugin:prettier/recommended
  - prettier
...
```
 
**Prettier Configurations**

Apply the following ruleset for Prettier:
``` .prettierrc
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 80
}
```

## 3. Migrate to a Frontend Framework
In this playground you will migrate your application to React with TypeScript while retaining the build and quality pipeline from Playground 2.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Establish the React application

Add React (or another framework of your choice) to the existing Vite and TypeScript project and migrate the page entry point to a React root. Preserve the build, linting, formatting, and CI setup from Playground 2, adapting scripts and configuration where necessary.

**Theory question:** Contrast imperative DOM updates with React's declarative model. What happens during React's render, reconciliation, and commit phases, and why should code outside React not modify DOM nodes owned by the React root? If you chose not to use React, answer the same questions in the context of your chosen framework.

#### Task 2: Design the component tree

Decompose the interface into components organised by feature. Use props where appropriate, keep rendering pure, and render bear collections with stable keys.

**Theory question:** Explain how component boundaries and typed props act as contracts. What makes a key stable, why does React need keys during reconciliation, and why is an array index unsuitable when list entries can change order?

#### Task 3: Model state and interaction

Implement the comment toggle, comment form, and search behavior with React events and state. Use controlled inputs, immutable updates, and derived values rather than duplicate state. Lift state only to the closest common owner that needs it.

**Theory question:** Distinguish props, stored state, and derived values. Explain why direct mutation can produce incorrect React behavior and when lifting state is preferable to introducing context.

#### Task 4: Load and represent remote data

Load and validate the bear data within the React application. Represent loading, success, empty, and error states explicitly; prevent stale requests from overwriting newer results; and retain the image fallback behavior from Playground 1.

**Theory question:** Why is fetching data a synchronization with an external system rather than part of pure rendering? Explain how cleanup or cancellation prevents race conditions when a component unmounts or a request becomes irrelevant.

#### Task 5: Add client-side routing and verify the migration

Add at least a list route and a bear-detail route using a stable bear identifier as a route parameter. Use query parameters for optional search/filter view state where appropriate. Verify that every requirement from Playground 1 still works and that all Playground 2 quality commands pass.

**Theory question:** Distinguish client-side rendering, a single-page application, and client-side routing. Compare route parameters with query parameters, and describe one benefit and one cost of the SPA architecture used here.

## In-Class Accessibility Workshop
You might have noticed that the base project has a number of accessibility issues - your task is to explore the existing site and fix them. Use the tools presented in our accessibility workshop to test the accessibility of your app and write a summary of your reports below.

### Tasks
* Accessibility Checks:
  * **Color**: Test the current color contrast (text/background), report the results of the test, and then fix them by changing the assigned colors.
  * **Semantic HTML**: Report on what happens when you try to navigate the page using a screen reader. Fix those navigation issues.
  * **Audio**: The ``<audio>`` player isn't accessible to hearing impaired people — can you add some kind of accessible alternative for these users?
  * **Forms**:
    * The ``<input>`` element in the search form at the top could do with a label, but we don't want to add a visible text label that would potentially spoil the design and isn't really needed by sighted users. Fix this issue by adding a label that is only accessible to screen readers.
    * The two ``<input>`` elements in the comment form have visible text labels, but they are not unambiguously associated with their labels — how do you achieve this? Note that you'll need to update some of the CSS rule as well.
  * **Comment Section**: The show/hide comment control button is not currently keyboard-accessible. Can you make it keyboard accessible, both in terms of focusing it using the tab key, and activating it using the return key?
  * **The table**: The data table is not currently very accessible — it is hard for screen reader users to associate data rows and columns together, and the table also has no kind of summary to make it clear what it shows. Can you add some features to your HTML to fix this problem?
